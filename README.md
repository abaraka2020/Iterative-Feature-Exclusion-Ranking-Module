# Iterative-Feature-Exclusion-Ranking-Module
Iterative Feature Exclusion Ranking for Deep Tabular Learning:
Iterative feature exclusion module that enhances the feature importance ranking in tabular data. The proposed module iteratively excludes each feature from the input data and computes the attention scores, which represent the impact of the features on the prediction. By aggregating the attention scores from each iteration, the proposed module generates a refined representation of feature importance that captures both global and local interactions between features.
